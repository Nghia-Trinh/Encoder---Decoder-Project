# Encoding/Decoding Names Project

See the
[Encoding/Decoding Names assignment](www.cs.kzoo.edu/cs230/Projects/EnDeCodingProj.html)
for the full instructions for this assignment, coding tips, links to helpful
documents, and submission requirements.  This document fills in details
related to using a Git repository associated with Kit.

### Getting the Right Files

The Encoding/Decoding Names repository comes with all of the files you need
for this project, including
two source files (instructionNames.c and registerNames.c) that you will be
completing, and a test driver (enDeCodingDriver.c) that is already written
for you.

### Compiling and Running Starter Code

You can compile and run the initial version of the code provided
in this repository, although of course the output will represent
an incomplete project.  You will need to compile all of the source files
together to create a single executable:
    gcc *.c
    ./a.out

As you work on the functions in instructionNames.c and registerNames.c, you
can repeatedly compile and run the test program to see improved test
results.

### Test and Commit/Push Early and Often

Following agile development principles, repeatedly Edit, Test, and Add/Commit
until the program is done. You can `git push` to Kit as often as you want.
(See the [Working with Git Repositories in
Kit](http://www.cs.kzoo.edu/CSShared/HelpFiles/Kit/RepositoryAssignments.md)
document for more information about writing a program within a Git
repository.)

### Before Final Submission

When you are ready to submit your work, click on the "Turn In" button. (You
can still push further changes to Kit after turning an assignment in if you
need to.)
