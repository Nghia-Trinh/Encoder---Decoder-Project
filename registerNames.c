/*
 * This file contains a static global array of register names and a
 * function, getRegName, that looks up and returns the mnemonic name for a
 * given register number.
 *
 *    Sample client code that calls getRegName:
 *        int rNbr1, rNbr2, rNbr3;         // register numbers between 0 and 31
 *        char *rName1, *rName2, *rName3;  // will point to names, e.g., "$t0"
 *        ...                              // set register numbers
 *        rName1 = getRegName (rNbr1);
 *        rName2 = getRegName (rNbr2);
 *        rName3 = getRegName (rNbr3);
 *        printf ("add %s, %s, %s\n", rName1, rName2, rName3);
 *    If rNbr1 = 8, rNbr2 = 9, rNbr3 = 16, this will print:
 *              add $t0, $t1, $s0
